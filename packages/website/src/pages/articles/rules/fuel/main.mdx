# Fuel

A ship needs fuel to move. Your ship will start with a full tank of fuel, which will depleted as you move around the map.

Once your fuel is depleted, you will be unable to move, and the ship will be stuck.

To refuel you need to visit a port. Port are black dots on the map. Once you are in a port, you can issue a `{ type: 'fuel-up', amount?: number }` command to refuel your ship.
If you do not specify an amount, your ship will be refueled to full.

If you do not have enough cash to refuel the requested amount, the command will be ignored.

You can calulate the price of fuel as `desiredAmount * currentPort.fuelPrice`.

Different ports can have different fuel prices, and you can use the `ports` property to look at prices on different ports.

To find the location of a port, you can use the `map` property. which contains all the tiles of the map. here the tile will have a `type` of `port` and an `id` of the port.

### Visibility
when you are at a port the `ports` property will contain all ports on the map, and their fuel prices.

When you are not at a port, the `ports` property will only contain the ports that are within your ships visibility range (`vessel.stats.visibility`).
