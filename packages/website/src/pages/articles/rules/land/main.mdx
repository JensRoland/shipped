# Land

Unfortunatly the world is not only water. There are also land tiles. Land tiles are not passable by ships.

You can use the `map` property to check which tiles are land.

It is generally a good idea to avoid sailing unto land as your ship would get stuck.

The bot below find connecting square tiles, check if they are water tiles and sails to a random one.
