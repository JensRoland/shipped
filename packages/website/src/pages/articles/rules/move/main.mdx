# Planning a route

So the first thing that you bot needs to learn is how to move the vessel around.

Everything the bot does, is done by returning a set of commands from its AI function.
There are different commands, but they all take the form of <code>{`{ type: string, [prop: string]: any }`}</code>.

To move the ship the Captain needs to provide a plan in the form of a series of waypoints, which the ship will follow.

The captain can at anytime give a new plan, and the ship will then start to follow the updated plan

<Playground
  map={map}
  vessel={vessel}
  script={import('./script.ts?raw')}
/>

<Bottom
  links={[
    { title: 'Next: Land', href: '/articles/rules/land' },
  ]}
/>
